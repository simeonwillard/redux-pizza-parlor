# React Pizza Parlor

## Description

Duration: 2 Day Sprint

React Pizza Parlor simulates a pizza restaurant. Users are able to order pizza, they can see how much their bill will be as they add pizzas to their order.  The user can add or remove pizzas from their order.  When the user is satisfied they can checkout, enter their customer information for either pickup or delivery.  The user can then review their order and checkout.  The admin can then log in and see all the orders that have been placed.  The time the order has been placed, the type of order (pickup or delivery), and the cost of the order, as well as who ordered it.   


## Prerequisites 

Node.js
PostgreSQL


## Installation

1. Create a database named 'pizza_parlor'.
2. The queries in the 'database.sql' file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the nedded dat to allow the application to run correctly.  The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to ake sure to have that installed.  I recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries.
3. Open your editor of choice and run an 'npm install'.
4. Run 'npm run server' in your terminal.
5. Run 'npm run client' in your terminal.
6. The 'npm run client' command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Usage

1.  A user can open up the app and view the menu of the pizza parlor.
2.  The user can choose to add/remove pizzas to their order.
3.  The user can then click the "checkout" button and select what type of order they want and enter the relevant information.
4.  The user can then review their order and confirm it.
5.  An admin user can log in and view all the orders that have been placed at the parlor.
